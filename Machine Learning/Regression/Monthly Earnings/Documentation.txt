    @ AveWeeklyHours ? It is certain (or known) that the number of hours worked affects salary.                                                               |
                       The salary is increased by increasing the number of hours                                                                              |

    @ IQ ? IQ affects salary (indirectly).                                                                                                                    |
           For example, a business manager gave two sales staff, one with a higher IQ than the other,                                                         |
           a new product that is foreign to the market; To market it, give it and let's call it rewarding.                                                    |
           It is believed that the employee with a higher IQ will find an innovative and effective way for                                                    |
           the other to market it from the other with a lower IQ. He may also find an idea,                                                                   |
           but it will certainly be less effective and may take longer than the first. Therefore, IQ certainly affects salary.                                |

    @ Knowledge ? Defining knowledge is the information and skills that a person has acquired through experience or education;                                |
                  Theoretical or practical understanding of the topic. In the previous example, suppose that the two employees                                |
                  found the idea of marketing the product, but its application and the sale of the largest possible quantity of                               |
                  the product depends on the employee’s ability to convince the customer of the product,                                                      |
                  and this requires skills, let it be persuasion skills and others. Thus, the employee who was able to                                        |
                  convince the largest number of customers will sell more. "He who sells more is better," and therefore                                       |
                  receives a higher salary "or, say, a premium." Thus, knowledge affects the salary (indirectly).                                             |

            --------------------------------------                                                                                                            |
    @ YearsEdu ? It may affect your salary, it may not. Suppose that there are two people who graduated from the FCI.                                         |
                 One of them was satisfied with his bachelor's degree, and the other continued his studies and obtained a doctorate,                          |
                 and the salary of a doctorate is certainly higher. Another possibility is that if the two obtain a doctorate, one of                         |
                 them obtained in a shorter number of years, it may not affect the salary "the same rank" (or the one who obtained it in                      |
                 fewer years has a higher salary). And the probability that the number of years of his education is few and his rank is                       |
                 high, like the football players. Also, his salary may be low.                                                                                |
                 The number of years of education is a relative matter, some things must be taken into account                                                |

    @ YearsExperience ? It will certainly affect the salary, for the salary of a recent graduate or a newcomer to working in a field is few,                  |
                        who has a less chance of solving work tasks, unlike an employee who has been working in the profession for a long time                |
                        who will be able to solve the tasks he “faced before” Faster. His salary will definitely be higher.                                   |

    @ Age ? There is a relationship between age and salary. Young people have a greater ability to be productive and creative than those who are old.         |
            Their salary will be relatively higher, while those with older age have more experience, it is possible that their salary will be higher          |
            (now age does not determine the extent of a person’s experience!!).                                                                               |
